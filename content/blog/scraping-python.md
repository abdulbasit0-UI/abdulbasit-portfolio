description: "How I built a robust, distributed web scraper using Scrapy, Docker, and MongoDB for data ingestion."
---

In one of my recent backend projects, I needed to extract structured data from multiple e-commerce sites at scale. After evaluating several tools, I chose **Scrapy** — a powerful Python framework for web scraping — and combined it with **Docker** and **MongoDB** for reliability and scalability.

This is how I built a maintainable, fault-tolerant scraper pipeline.

## Why Scrapy?

While `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` works for simple scripts, Scrapy offers:

- Built-in request throttling
- Middleware support (proxies, retries)
- Async crawling via Twisted
- Extensible pipelines
- Stats collection and logging

```python
import scrapy

class ProductSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "product_spider"
    start_urls = [
        "https://example-shop.com/products?page=1"
    ]

    def parse(self, response):
        for product in response.css('.product-item'):
            yield {
                'name': product.css('.title::text').get(),
                'price': product.css('.price::text').get(),
                'url': product.css('a::attr(href)').get(),
            }

        # Follow pagination
        next_page = response.css('.next-page::attr(href)').get()
        if next_page:
            yield response.follow(next_page, self.parse)
