## 📝 Writing Blog Posts

All blog posts are written in Markdown and stored in `content/blog/`.

### Example:

```md
---
title: "Building a Web Scraper with Python and Scrapy"
date: "2025-04-05"
description: "How I built a robust, distributed scraper using Scrapy, Docker, and MongoDB."
---

In one of my recent backend projects...
```

Just drop a `.md` file in `/content/blog/` — it automatically appears on the blog index and is accessible at `/blog/[slug]`.

---

## 🔦 Interactive Terminal

A fun, developer-centric feature where visitors can type commands:

- `skills` – View your tech stack
- `experience` – Work history
- `education` – Academic background
- `projects` – Notable work
- `blog` – Recent articles
- `clear` – Clear the screen
- `help` – List all commands

Built entirely client-side with React. Proves you think like a developer.

---

## 🖥️ Live API Endpoint

Demonstrates your ability to build real backend services.

- Endpoint: `GET /api/status`
- Returns: JSON with uptime, timestamp, and service status
- Used on the homepage to show your portfolio is "alive"

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "Alex's backend is running smoothly 🚀",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-05T10:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123
}
```

---

## 🌙 Dark Mode

Toggle between light and dark themes with persistent preference via `localStorage`.  
Styles are handled by **Tailwind CSS** with `dark:` variants.

---

## 🎯 Why This Stands Out

This isn't just a resume site — it's a **demonstration of backend craftsmanship**:
- You write real blog posts
- You build real APIs
- You design for clarity, not noise
- And yes, you even added a terminal — because you can.

Welcome to the portfolio of a developer who ships.
